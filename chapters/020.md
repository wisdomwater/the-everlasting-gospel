## 20 - Love That Cannot Be Silenced

> *What heals the world will always unsettle what feeds on fear.*

There is something in the soul—human or otherwise—that resists the thought of surrender. Pride trembles at the idea of being brought low, not because humility is cruel, but because it feels like the end of control. To such a will, the promise that all things will one day bow to Love does not sound like hope, but like loss.

And yet this is precisely what the gospel carries: not the triumph of domination, but the quiet undoing of everything that thrives on separation. What is diabolical—pride, envy, rage—cannot survive in the presence of a Love that refuses to compete and will not be extinguished. Such Love does not argue; it outlasts.

It is no wonder that this vision meets resistance. Even gentle truths can feel threatening when they loosen long-held certainties. Traditions, fears, and inherited images of God sometimes rise up to defend themselves. But Love does not need defenders. It moves with a strength that does not shout, and it finds its way into the hearts of those who are ready to hear.

The Love revealed here is not fragile. It is fierce without violence, patient without weakness. No flood can drown it. No opposition can exhaust it. What begins in mercy will end in peace—not because it was uncontested, but because it was unquenchable.

Sit gently with this question:

> *Where might Love be asking you to trust its strength rather than defend your certainty?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Love unquenchable*
- Out: *I rest in Your peace*
