## 58 - When Mercy Is Wider Than Fear

> *Hope grows where love is trusted to be stronger than darkness.*

Some visions of the world leave the heart with a quiet dread—that goodness is fragile, that darkness finally wins more than love saves. When mercy is imagined as brief or scarce, the soul learns to settle for a shallow peace, mistaking small stirrings of goodness for deep transformation. Urgency fades, not because love is embraced, but because fear is postponed.

Yet fear has never been a reliable healer. When the conscience awakens—especially near the end of life—terror does not bring clarity. It tightens the heart. It convinces the wounded soul that it has gone too far, resisted too long, failed beyond repair. In such moments, a narrow mercy offers little comfort. It leaves the soul alone with its despair.

But there is another vision—one that steadies the trembling heart. A mercy that does not expire at death. A love whose strength exceeds the weight of sin, whose patience outlasts resistance. In this light, judgment is no longer the final word, but a necessary passage toward healing. What is false is exposed so it can be released; what is broken is faced so it can be restored.

To trust this mercy is not to escape responsibility, but to place it in honest hands. It invites us to begin the work now—to consent willingly to truth, to allow love to undo what harms us—knowing that even if we falter, we are not abandoned. Darkness does not have the last word. Love does.

Sit gently with this question:

> *Where do I most need to trust that mercy is stronger than my fear?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *Everlasting mercy*
* Out: *Hold me in hope*
