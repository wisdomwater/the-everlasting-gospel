## 5 - The Will That Waits

> *What Love truly desires is not abandoned, even when it unfolds slowly.*

Nothing in God is casual or half-meant. What arises from the divine will is not a wish that fades with resistance, but a steady intention held with patience and strength. Time may stretch, and fulfillment may seem delayed, but what is willed from Love does not dissolve.

God does not will loss, erasure, or final ruin. What is desired is life—turning, awakening, restoration. This longing is not weak or sentimental. It is grounded, resolute, and spacious enough to hold long seasons of wandering without letting go of the end toward which it moves.

When change does not come quickly, it is not because Love has failed, but because Love allows room. Freedom is honored. Growth is not rushed. What cannot yet be received gently may wait for another hour, another age, another quiet opening of the heart.

The story does not end in fragmentation. What was made will be renewed. What was scattered will be gathered into right order again. Love’s intention is not merely to begin things well, but to bring them home.

Rest with this question:

> *What hope might you allow yourself if Love’s patience is longer than your fear?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Your will is faithful*
- Out: *I trust the long unfolding*
