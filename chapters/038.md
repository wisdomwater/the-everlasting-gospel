## 38 - The Seasons We Pass Through

> *History moves through changing seasons, but God abides in a deeper stillness beyond them all.*

Scripture speaks of different “worlds,” not as separate planets, but as seasons of time—ways life unfolds under particular conditions. This present world is marked by mixture: beauty and sorrow, kindness and cruelty, longing and resistance living side by side. It is the age where fear often speaks louder than love, and where goodness can feel fragile and contested.

The writings do not promise that this season steadily improves. They are honest about the weight carried here, about patterns that repeat and intensify. Yet they also refuse despair. Even in difficult times, seeds are planted. Quiet faithfulness appears in unexpected places. Love works patiently, often unnoticed, preparing what it alone can complete.

Beyond this age, Scripture gestures toward another—a world to come—where the struggle that defines this season no longer has the same hold. And beyond even that, it names something rarer and more mysterious still: a still, silent eternity, where striving ceases altogether and God is simply all in all. This is not an age of effort or correction, but of rest.

These distinctions are not given to satisfy curiosity about the future, but to steady the heart in the present. What we are living now is not the whole story. This season will pass. What endures is the quiet faithfulness of God, holding all ages—past, present, and yet to come—within a love deeper than time.

Listen to what this question stirs:

> *What would it change for you to remember that this season is not the final word?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You hold every age*
* Out: *I rest in Your stillness*
