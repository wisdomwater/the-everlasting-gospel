## 45 - The Amen That Cannot Lie

> *A prayer born of love carries its own fulfillment.*

When we are taught to pray for all, we are not being invited into pretense. We are being drawn into the heart of God. The *Amen* we speak is not a fragile hope, crossed with doubt—it is a quiet trust that what love asks for, love intends to complete. God does not teach the soul to ask for what God refuses to give.

To imagine otherwise would wound the very meaning of prayer. It would turn trust into contradiction, and hope into performance. But the prayer we are given flows from a love that does not deceive. It teaches us to desire what God already wills: the healing of every life, the return of every wanderer, the restoration of what has been lost.

Love may be resisted for a time. Some paths wind through long darkness. Yet resistance does not make love false, nor delay make it weak. What is asked in faith is not annulled by slowness. The seed remains alive until the ground is ready. Grace waits—not anxiously, but faithfully.

To pray without wrath or doubting is to rest in this truth: God does not will in vain. Mercy is not spoken lightly. No life is written off as a failed investment of love. The One who asks us to pray for all already holds all within the reach of redemption.

Give this question your gentle attention:

> *What would change in you if you trusted that God never teaches the heart to hope in what will finally be denied?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *Your will is faithful and true*
* Out: *Amen—so be it in love*
