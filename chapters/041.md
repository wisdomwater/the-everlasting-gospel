## 41 - When Justice Finishes Its Work

> *Judgment endures only until resistance is healed and every heart can finally bow in truth.*

There are lives and powers that oppose love with great force, wounding others deeply and persistently. Scripture does not soften the seriousness of this. What has harmed must be faced. What has been inflicted must be answered. There are seasons when mercy waits in silence while justice speaks clearly, allowing deeds to be fully met and fully felt.

Yet even here, justice is not the opposite of restoration. It is the long, hard path by which restoration becomes possible. Those who once opposed truth most fiercely are not forced into false submission, but are brought—through time, consequence, and humbling—into a place where pride can no longer stand. The bowing that comes at the end is not coerced. It is born of recognition.

What was once rejection becomes consent. What was once accusation becomes silence. And finally, silence gives way to reconciliation. Not quickly. Not cheaply. But truly. When the work of judgment has finished what it was meant to do, it does not linger. It yields to peace.

The story Scripture tells is not of endless conflict, but of an end to conflict. Not of love giving up, but of love waiting until it can be received. In the end, every knee bends not because it must, but because it finally sees.

Be present to this question:

> *What would it mean for you to trust that justice serves healing, even when it takes a long road?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You see every wound*
* Out: *You bring all things to peace*
