## 51 - Taken Hold Of

> *Love chooses intimacy first, without abandoning the rest.*

There is a tenderness in the way Christ is said to “take hold” of humanity—not as a grasp of possession, but as a choosing of closeness. He draws near to those who trust him, receives them into kinship, and shares his own life with them. This nearness is not a reward for superiority, but a gift of fellowship freely given.

To be taken hold of in this way is to be drawn into shared life—into friendship, inheritance, and mutual belonging. It speaks of being held fast, not only by Christ’s own care, but within the care of the Father, where nothing can be torn away. This is the privilege of those who awaken early to trust: a depth of communion, a share in responsibility, a closeness that shapes the coming ages.

Yet this choosing does not imply abandonment of others. To say that Christ takes hold of humanity in this particular way is not to say that angels—or any other creatures—fall outside his healing work. It is simply to say that love begins somewhere, forming a first circle of intimacy through which wider restoration flows. Nearness is ordered, not exclusive.

Even judgment itself, in this light, is not the final word. It serves the work of truth, humility, and healing—until what resists love can finally receive it. Nothing in God’s dealing aims at endless harm. All correction bends toward restoration. Love’s purpose does not change, even when its path is long.

Let yourself linger with this question:

> *What might it mean for you to trust that being “chosen” is about closeness now, not exclusion forever?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You hold me close*
* Out: *You do not let go*
