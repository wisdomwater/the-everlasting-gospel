## 35 - The First Awakening

> *Some awaken early to love, not because they are favored more, but because they have yielded sooner.*

There are those who allow themselves to be born again while time is still open—who consent to transformation now, rather than later. They do not arrive by merit or strength, but by trust. They let love remake them while the day is still gentle, and they learn to belong to Christ from within this life.

Scripture gives them many tender names, not to elevate them above others, but to describe intimacy. They are spoken of as friends, companions, family—those who live close to the heart of God. Their closeness is not a reward but a relationship formed early, shaped through attention, faithfulness, and love freely given.

Even among these early awakeners, there is variety. Each carries a different brightness, a different depth of healing, a different capacity to receive and reflect grace. Love does not press all souls into the same mold. It honors the uniqueness of each journey, each gift, each willingness to be transformed.

These first awakeners are marked not by outward signs, but by a quiet belonging. They are known because they have allowed themselves to be known. They carry within them a readiness to serve, to bless, to participate in love’s work. What they receive is not only joy, but responsibility—an invitation to share in the care of what is still becoming whole.

Sit gently with this question:

> *Where might you be invited to awaken more fully now, rather than later?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You call me by name*
* Out: *I open myself to Your life*
