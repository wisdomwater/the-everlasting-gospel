## 19 - When Pride Finally Softens

> *Grace waits patiently until humility makes room for healing.*

There are depths to pride that cannot be reasoned away. What clings to self-exaltation resists help not because mercy is lacking, but because surrender feels unbearable. Love does not force itself into such places. It waits, even when the waiting is long, until all the false supports have fallen away and the heart can no longer stand on its own illusion of strength.

Humility is not humiliation. It is the quiet moment when resistance exhausts itself and the soul, weary of striving, bows not in defeat but in truth. Grace meets that moment without delay. Wherever humility appears—no matter how late, no matter how deep the fall—mercy is already present, ready to lift.

For those still enthralled by pride, even the promise of restoration can feel threatening. To be told that all power will one day yield to Love is unbearable to a will that longs to rule. And so the message of eventual healing sounds like loss rather than hope. What heals later feels terrifying now.

Yet Love does not change its aim. What is brought low is not crushed, but returned to right order. When pride finally loosens its grip, what once felt like shame becomes relief. What once felt like defeat becomes homecoming. Grace has been waiting all along.

Stand at the threshold of this question:

> *Where might letting go of pride feel frightening—and yet quietly freeing?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *When I can no longer stand*
- Out: *Meet me with grace*
