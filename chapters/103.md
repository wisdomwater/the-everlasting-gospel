## Section 3 — The Language of Fire, Prison, and Exclusion

Some passages in Scripture stop us in our tracks. Their imagery is stark, their language severe, and their history heavy with fear. For many, these are the texts that first taught us to be afraid of God—or to be afraid of ourselves in God’s presence. Fire without end. Doors that close. Prison with no clear release. These words deserve to be approached slowly, with care for the wounds they may touch.

This section does not seek to soften these passages by denying their seriousness, nor to explain them away as if they do not matter. Instead, it seeks to hold them without panic. Scripture often speaks in symbol, parable, and vision—especially when it is grappling with realities that resist simple description. The aim of such language is not to terrorize the reader, but to impress urgency, consequence, and the cost of clinging to what destroys life.

As we sit with these texts, we are invited to ask not only *what images are used*, but *to what end they point*. Fire appears not only as destruction, but as exposure. Prison appears not as arbitrary cruelty, but as the natural outcome of unresolved conflict. Exclusion is named not as God’s desire, but as the consequence of refusing communion. When read within the wider witness of Scripture—and especially in the light of Christ—these images begin to speak less of abandonment and more of a love that will not collude with illusion.

Read gently. Breathe. You are not asked to resolve these passages, only to notice whether they might carry a purpose deeper than fear, and whether even here, the story God is telling is moving—slowly, firmly—toward healing rather than despair.

These are the passages many of us learned to fear. Their images linger in the imagination—fire that does not go out, doors that close, smoke that rises without end. For some, these words were not simply read; they were absorbed as threat. They shaped a vision of God as one who finally gives up, locks the gate, and turns away forever. It is important to acknowledge how heavy this language can feel, especially for those whose faith was formed under urgency rather than trust.

Scripture, however, often speaks in symbols when it reaches the limits of ordinary language. Apocalyptic and prophetic texts are not blueprints of the afterlife, but visions meant to awaken moral clarity in the present. Fire, prison, and exclusion name the seriousness of clinging to what destroys life. They dramatize consequence so that illusion can be broken and choice can be seen clearly. The aim is not to describe God’s emotional state, but to reveal what resistance to love does to the soul.

Much of the fear surrounding these passages comes from reading them as flat, literal descriptions rather than as symbolic speech. Even the word translated *eternal* carries a depth that is often missed. When paired with life, it points to the fullness and quality of God’s own life. When paired with judgment, it speaks to judgment that belongs to God’s order—weighty, real, and decisive—without requiring that it be endless in duration or opposed to restoration. The gravity is shared; the purpose is not.

When these texts are read within the wider movement of Scripture, a pattern begins to emerge. Prison imagery suggests accountability with an end in view. Fire reveals and refines, burning away what cannot endure while leaving the person intact. Even Revelation’s most severe visions are set within a larger story that moves toward open gates, healing nations, and the undoing of death itself. Darkness is exposed, judged, and finally overcome—not preserved forever.

Held this way, these passages need not teach us to despair or to picture God as eager to abandon. Instead, they confront us with the truth that love will not collude with what deforms us. They insist that choices matter, that resistance has consequence, and that healing may be costly. Yet even here, the story Scripture tells is not one of final rejection, but of a love strong enough to face evil fully and patient enough to see its end.
