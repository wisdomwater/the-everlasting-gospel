## 2 - Love That Does Not Let Go

> *Nothing God allows or permits is born from hatred or meant for abandonment.*

Love does not create what it intends to despise. What comes into being does so because it is wanted, seen, and held as worth the breath that gave it life. Even when we wander far from our original harmony, that first intention does not evaporate.

There are moments when love takes a form we would not choose for ourselves. It may feel like resistance, correction, or sorrow. Yet this, too, is not a sign of rejection. Love that cares enough to stay present will sometimes press against what harms us—not to destroy, but to heal what has grown disordered.

Grief is never the final word. What weighs heavily is not imposed with pleasure or cruelty, but carried with patience. Mercy does not rush, and it does not give up. What feels like severity on the surface may be, at its center, a fierce refusal to abandon what can still be restored.

The same Love that creates, protects, and sustains also works to mend. Nothing that comes from this Love is aimed at endless ruin. Even when the path is long and difficult, its direction bends toward preservation, renewal, and return.

Stay with this question in quiet attentiveness:

> *Where might you be open to seeing correction or difficulty as care rather than rejection?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Love that remains*
- Out: *I am not abandoned*
