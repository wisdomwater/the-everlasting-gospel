## 60 - God All in All

> *When nothing remains outside of love, the soul can finally rest.*

There is a longing beneath many of our fears—the hope that the story does not end in fracture, that no part of life is finally abandoned, that love does not stop short of completion. To say that God will be *all in all* is to name that longing without rushing it. It is the quiet assurance that nothing true is lost, and nothing broken is allowed to define the end.

This wholeness does not erase our stories or smooth away difference. It gathers them. What is healed is not individuality, but separation. What falls away is not identity, but the fear that made us guard it so tightly. God being all in all means that every place of resistance has been met, every wound tended, every distance crossed—not by force, but by patient presence.

In this vision, judgment has finished its work. Mercy has done what it set out to do. Nothing remains that needs correction, because nothing remains that is hidden from love. The long labor of becoming gives way to rest—not an ending of life, but life unburdened. Being without fear. Belonging without condition.

To live with this hope is not to escape the present, but to inhabit it more gently. If God will be all in all, then even now nothing we face is meaningless, and nothing we are is disposable. The future toward which all things move is not silence, but harmony—and the invitation is simply to trust that love knows how to finish what it begins.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What would it feel like to believe that no part of me, and no part of the world, is ultimately outside of love?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *All things held*
* Out: *All things healed*
