## 24 - The Returning of All Things

> *All ages move toward a quiet homecoming, where nothing is lost and everything is gathered into God.*

Time is not a straight line disappearing into cold distance. It is more like a river with many bends, widening and narrowing, sometimes rushing, sometimes resting. The ages overlap and succeed one another, each carrying what it has held, each moving toward a deeper stillness. Even what feels final is not severed from what comes next.

There is spoken of a moment when all labor is complete—not in exhaustion, but in fulfillment—when the work of love has reached its fullness. Then everything that has been entrusted is gently returned, not diminished, not erased, but gathered back into its source. Nothing essential is lost. Glory is not taken away. Relationship is not undone. All is held within a greater harmony.

What we call “forever” is not always what it seems. Some things endure only for a season, though they feel endless while we are inside them. Even the age marked by distortion and fear has its limit. It is not the final word. Beyond it lies a deeper eternity—quiet, spacious, and whole—where God is no longer opposed by anything, and nothing stands outside the embrace of love.

Sit gently with this question:

> *Where in your life do you sense something moving toward rest, even if it is not yet complete?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *All things return to You*
* Out: *You are my rest*
