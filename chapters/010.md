## 10 - The Nature Beneath the Fall

> *What turned away from Love is not what Love created.*

There is a longing within every creature to stand on its own—to be sufficient, independent, unruled. Yet this kind of self-grounded life belongs only to God. When a creature reaches for that place, it does not become greater; it becomes unmoored. The fall is not the gaining of power, but the loss of center.

What Scripture names as evil in fallen beings is not their created nature, but the will that stepped outside its true home. The turning away, the refusal to remain in humility and trust—this is what fractures. This is what becomes hostile. This is what Love cannot affirm. And yet, even here, Love does not mistake the distortion for the essence.

Beneath the disorder, the original gift remains. What was made by Love is still known by Love. The angelic nature—like the human one—has not been erased, only obscured. What God formed is not hated. What God formed is remembered. And what God remembers, God does not abandon.

Reconciliation, then, is not denial of the fall, but the patient work of untangling it. Love moves toward restoring right order, not all at once, not by force, but in its own time. The end is not perpetual conflict or sorrow, but a healing so complete that grief itself no longer has a place to stand.

Allow this question to unfold in you:

> *What if even what seems most opposed to Love is not beyond being gently brought home?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *You know my true nature*
- Out: *Lead me back to center*
