## 23 - Seasons Within Forever

> *Not every “forever” speaks the same language of time.*

Scripture speaks with a spaciousness that does not always fit our modern precision. Sometimes “everlasting” points to God alone—without beginning, without end, beyond time’s reach. At other times, the same word is used to name a gift given within time, held securely because it is rooted in God’s faithfulness. And still other times, it names a season—long, weighty, meaningful—but not endless.

This does not weaken the promise; it clarifies it. What God gives is always true to its purpose. Some things are meant to last through all ages. Others are meant to serve for a time and then gently give way to something fuller. The word “forever” stretches to hold both realities, not to confuse us, but to invite trust rather than calculation.

Eternal life, as Christ speaks of it, is not merely unending duration. It is a quality of life—knowing, belonging, being held in communion. It begins now, unfolds through time, and is carried forward because its source does not fade. This is not threatened by change; it is sustained through it.

When we rest in this, we no longer need to force every mystery into rigid categories. We can allow God’s promises to mean exactly what Love intends—no less, and no more—and trust that what is meant to endure will be kept.

Sit gently with this question:

> *Where might releasing rigid timelines help you trust the faithfulness of God more deeply?*
