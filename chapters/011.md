## 11 - The Measure of Love

> *To be filled with God is to let Love grow wider than our judgments.*

There is a subtle temptation to draw lines where Love has drawn none—to decide who is worthy of mercy and who stands beyond its reach. This impulse often wears the mask of certainty, yet beneath it lies a failure of humility. When we lose touch with our own fragility, our compassion for others begins to shrink.

Love, as God knows it, does not sort creatures into favored and forsaken. It does not respect persons or rank wounds. It looks upon all that has been made and remembers its own handiwork. Mercy is not parceled out in measured portions; it flows over everything that bears the mark of having been created.

To know the love of Christ is not to master a concept, but to be undone by its scale. Its breadth exceeds our categories. Its depth reaches what we would rather not see. Its height lifts even what has fallen farthest from view. This Love refuses to be confined within the limits of human reasoning or fear.

When we resist the wideness of mercy, it is not God we protect, but ourselves. Yet Love waits even here—patient with our smallness, inviting us to grow. The fullness of God is not found in exclusion, but in the slow expansion of the heart.

Sit gently with this question:

> *Where might your understanding of Love be ready to widen?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Widen my heart*
- Out: *Teach me Your measure*
