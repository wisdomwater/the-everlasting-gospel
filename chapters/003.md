## 3 - When Love Feels Severe

> *What we call wrath is Love meeting resistance without giving up.*

At the deepest level, nothing God does toward creation rises from cruelty or malice. Love cannot endlessly wound what it cherishes. Even pain, when it comes from this source, is not meant to humiliate or destroy, but to awaken, to soften, to bring what has hardened back toward life.

All that God is—wisdom, holiness, justice, mercy—flows from the same living center. There is no hidden edge in God that contradicts Love. When Scripture speaks of wrath, it is naming how Love is experienced when it meets what resists its ordering. The same warmth that comforts can feel unbearable when we turn away from it.

Love does not change its nature; our posture toward it changes how it is received. To the open and humble, it feels gentle and sustaining. To the proud or closed, it can feel sharp and unsettling. Yet even then, it is not working against us, but pressing toward our healing, refusing to leave us trapped in what diminishes us.

What feels like God’s severity is not the final word. It is a temporary labor, a strange and painful mercy, making space for Love to do what it most longs to do—restore, console, and gather back what has been scattered.

Quietly ask yourself:

> *Where might Love be pressing against you—not to punish, but to bring you back to life?*

- In: *Love that does not abandon*
- Out: *Soften what resists*
