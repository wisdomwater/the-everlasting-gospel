## 34 - The Fire That Heals

> *Every trial is permitted for healing, not for loss.*

All the ways God meets human brokenness—here or beyond this life—flow from one source: love that refuses to abandon what it has made. Even anger, in the sacred language, is not opposed to love but arises from it. What wounds is allowed only so far as it can awaken, soften, and restore what has grown hard.

In this sense, there is no single place reserved for cleansing. Life itself carries many such moments. Every hardship, every season of loss or resistance, every quiet unraveling of false securities becomes a kind of purifying fire. These are not punishments chosen for cruelty, but invitations—gentle when they can be, severe only when gentleness is refused.

If we learn in these smaller fires, much is spared us. If not, love does not give up. It continues its work beyond death, holding even the most resistant hearts in conditions strong enough to humble and soften them. Nothing God allows is wasted. Nothing is permitted without an end shaped by mercy.

Yet there is a wisdom in choosing now. The lighter afflictions of this life, when received with openness, carry within them a freedom that cannot be given later in the same way. What is learned early becomes joy; what is learned late still becomes healing, but without the fullness of that joy. Love restores all—but not all share the same nearness, brightness, or ease in that restoration.

Allow this question to unfold in you:

> *What might be asking to soften in you now, before it must be softened by greater fire?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *Your love purifies me*
* Out: *I yield without fear*
