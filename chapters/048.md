## 48 - When Subjection Becomes Communion

> *The end of God’s work is not forced obedience, but willing union.*

There is a kind of submission that bends under pressure, and another that opens from love. Scripture knows the difference. What is compelled may restrain harm for a time, but it does not heal the heart. True restoration does not stop at silencing rebellion; it waits until resistance itself has been transformed into consent.

The language of “all things being placed under Christ” is not a picture of souls trapped forever in fear or pain. It is a vision of order restored—of disorder gently undone. Death, in all its forms, is not preserved as a monument to justice, but dissolved. What once stung is rendered harmless. What once separated no longer exists. Nothing remains that can oppose life.

When it is said that God will be *all in all*, this speaks of intimacy, not domination. It is the quiet mystery of God’s own life flowing freely through every creature—each distinct, each alive, each fully at rest. This cannot happen while sin and death still occupy the heart. And so they do not remain. They are swallowed up, not by force, but by fullness.

There is a difference between the first bowing and the final one. The first may be stiff, reluctant, even fearful. The last is free. It rises from truth recognized and embraced. This is the subjection God desires—not that creatures be crushed into order, but that they find themselves at home within it.

Pause with this question:

> *What would it be like to let obedience grow into trust, and trust into love?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You seek willing hearts*
* Out: *I open myself to Your life*
