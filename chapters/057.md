## 57 - A Kingdom Wide Enough

> *God’s purpose is not narrowed by our categories, but unfolds in a harmony where none are lost and each is met in truth.*

Human minds have long tried to divide what love is doing—who belongs where, who receives more, who receives less. Yet beneath these distinctions is a deeper rhythm: God’s will does not fail. What God truly desires is not left unfinished. Every life is drawn, in its own way and time, into willing participation with what is good.

Some awaken early. They learn to trust sooner, to yield more freely, to live already in the joy of cooperation. Others resist longer, needing sharper mercy and slower healing. But the end is not competition—it is communion. Differences of timing do not undo the wideness of the invitation.

This vision does not diminish grace; it magnifies it. Nothing earned is erased, and nothing unfinished is forgotten. Justice refines without discarding. Mercy completes what discipline begins. The kingdom is not thinned to preserve holiness, but purified until holiness can be shared.

When the heart rests in this assurance, urgency is softened without becoming careless. The desire to turn toward God now is not driven by fear of exclusion, but by love’s quiet appeal: why wait to become whole?

Sit gently with this question:

> *What would change if I trusted that God’s purpose is both patient and complete?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *Faithful love*
* Out: *Bring all things home*
