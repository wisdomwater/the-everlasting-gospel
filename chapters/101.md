## Section 1 — God’s Desire Is Wider Than We Were Taught

Before Scripture speaks of judgment, discipline, or transformation, it speaks of desire. Again and again, the biblical witness returns to the heart of God—not as distant decree, but as longing. These passages do not describe a God reluctantly saving a few, nor a mercy that must be argued into existence. They speak, instead, of a goodness that precedes repentance, a compassion that outlasts resistance, and a will toward life that does not quietly expire.

What is striking in these texts is not their urgency alone, but their tenderness. God does not delight in loss. God does not afflict willingly. God’s mercy is not rationed according to worthiness, but flows from love for what has been made. Even when grief is named, it is never severed from compassion; even when turning is required, it is invited, not coerced.

Many of us did not encounter God first as desire, but as danger. Before we learned to pray, we learned to brace. The air around faith was thick with urgency, warnings, and the sense that one misstep—one unconfessed sin, one wrong belief, one unfinished repentance—might tip the scales forever. Even when love was spoken of, it often arrived shadowed by fear, as though mercy were fragile and time were always running out.

When fear shapes the earliest image of God, it does not remain an idea—it settles into the body. God can begin to feel watchful rather than welcoming, eager to judge rather than slow to heal. Over time, this can quietly distort the soul’s posture: trust gives way to vigilance, honesty to self-protection, and desire to compliance. Faith becomes something to manage rather than a relationship to enter.

Against this background, the tone of these scriptures can feel almost surprising. Here, God does not speak as one seeking reasons to condemn, but as one grieving loss and longing for life. There is no pleasure in destruction, no delight in affliction. Even judgment is framed as reluctant, purposeful, and bound to compassion. Desire comes first—desire for return, for healing, for life restored.

This matters deeply. If God’s deepest movement toward creation is desire, then discipline is not rejection, and judgment is not abandonment. Correction flows from love, not from impatience. These texts invite us to consider that before anything is asked of us—before turning, before repentance, before change—we are already wanted. And it is this wanting, this steady and patient desire, that makes transformation possible at all.
