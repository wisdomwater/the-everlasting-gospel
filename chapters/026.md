## 26 - What Has No Root Cannot Last

> *Only what is born in God endures without end.*

Not everything that feels endless truly is. Some things last a very long time—long enough to feel overwhelming, consuming, even inescapable—yet they do not carry eternity within themselves. They arise, they persist, and in time they pass. What gives something its lastingness is not its intensity, but its source.

Evil does not spring from God. It has no deep root in the Divine life. It grows within created freedom, within the ages of becoming, where will can turn away as well as toward. And because it does not originate in God, it cannot endure as God endures. What is not sustained by love cannot remain forever.

There are seasons of reckoning that are severe, sobering, and unimaginably long to those who enter them. They are not minimized here. Pain is not explained away. But neither are these seasons made infinite beyond their truth. They last as long as they must—long enough to be real, long enough to matter, long enough to bring what is hidden into the light—but not longer than love requires.

What *does* endure without end is what belongs to God: life, mercy, restoration, communion. Glory has its root in the Eternal and therefore shares in Eternity’s nature. Healing is not temporary. Love does not exhaust itself. What is of God remains, and what is not is gently, firmly, and finally undone.

Let this question rest in your care:

> *What in you feels permanent simply because it has been painful for a long time?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *Only Your love is eternal*
* Out: *I release what cannot last*
