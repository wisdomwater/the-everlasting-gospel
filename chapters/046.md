## 46 - Mercy That Misses Nothing

> *What love creates, love refuses to abandon.*

Scripture speaks with a steady tenderness here. God’s mercy does not narrow itself to a favored few, nor does it withdraw when creation falters. Love looks upon everything it has made and does not recoil. Nothing exists by accident. Nothing is sustained by indifference. What is, remains because it is still wanted.

This mercy is not fragile or sentimental. It is strong enough to endure corruption without surrendering its purpose. What has fallen has not slipped beyond care. What has resisted has not escaped belonging. The Spirit that called all things into being still breathes within them, holding them toward restoration.

All things come from God, move through God, and are carried—slowly, patiently—back toward God. This return does not erase distinction or dissolve the creature into the Creator. It heals separation. What cannot survive this returning is not the creature, but the wound that divided it from love. Sin fades where love is fully received. Fear loosens. Unhappiness has no place left to stand.

In Christ, this movement is gathered into one clear promise. What was made through him is reconciled through him. Nothing created lies outside this work. Heaven and earth, seen and unseen, are drawn into peace by a love that does not stop halfway. The One who holds all things together does not release his hold until all things are made whole.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What would it mean to trust that nothing about you is outside the reach of God’s mercy?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *Your mercy holds all things*
* Out: *I rest in Your love*
