## 47 - When All Things Are Reheaded in Love

> *Nothing created is left outside the circle of reconciliation.*

Reconciliation is not a narrow act. It spreads quietly, patiently, until it touches everything that was ever fractured by separation. When what has wandered is drawn back into harmony, joy ripples outward—among angels, among creation itself. Healing is never isolated. It restores relationship wherever relationship was strained.

The reach of this reconciliation is wide enough to lift the weight that has pressed upon the world since the first fracture. What groans under curse and futility is not forgotten. The earth itself waits for release, for the day when nothing remains bent out of shape, and all that was burdened can breathe freely again.

Scripture names this mystery as a gathering—a reheading of all things in Christ. What has been scattered is brought home. What has lost its center finds it again. Heaven and earth, visible and unseen, are drawn into one living order, not by force, but by patient authority that knows how to restore what it governs.

Even now, this work is underway, though not yet complete. We do not yet see everything resting where it belongs. But the promise stands firm: nothing will remain unhealed. Even death itself—the last enemy—will one day fall silent. And when that work is finished, God will no longer be known through opposition or overcoming, but simply as *all in all*.

Allow this question to unfold in you:

> *What part of your life longs to be gathered back into harmony rather than held together by effort?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You gather all things in love*
* Out: *Bring me home to wholeness*
