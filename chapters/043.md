## 43 - When Love Prays for All

> *The prayer spoken from the cross carries farther than our resistance.*

Before a single accusation could be answered, love spoke first. From the place of deepest wounding, Christ did not ask for retribution, but for forgiveness—not only for those who struck him then, but for all who would wound love again across the long unfolding of history. This prayer was not hesitant. It was not unsure. It was spoken with the quiet confidence of one who knows the heart of God.

The words spoken from the cross reveal something essential: love does not wait for understanding before it begins to heal. It intercedes even for those who do not yet know what they are doing. And this intercession is not fragile or easily refused. The One who prays assures us that every prayer rising from this love is heard—fully, faithfully, and in time, completely.

When we are taught to pray for all—to ask that every heart be delivered from evil—we are being invited into God’s own desire. This prayer is not wishful thinking. It is alignment. To pray that all be freed from the power of harm is to stand within a promise already moving toward fulfillment. The kingdom we ask to come does not belong to fear or destruction, but to love alone.

Some may resist this prayer for a long while. Some may push its healing far into the future. But resistance does not nullify love’s intent. The prayer remains, working quietly, patiently, until what is asked can finally be received. In the end, deliverance from evil will not glorify the will of the creature, but the faithfulness of God—whose mercy does not abandon its own asking.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What would it change for you to trust that love’s prayer for you will not fail?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You pray even for me*
* Out: *I rest in Your mercy*
