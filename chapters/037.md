## 37 - When Every Knee Softens

> *Even the longest resistance is not stronger than love’s patience.*

There are paths that wind far into darkness before they turn toward the light. Some souls resist healing until nothing else can reach them—until even the severest reckonings have done their slow, humbling work. These journeys are not brief, nor are they gentle. They stretch across ages that feel unending, until pride finally loosens and every will learns how to bow.

The ancient images speak of differences even here—not to measure suffering, but to honor the mystery of timing. Some awaken sooner, others much later. Some remain bound longer than others, not because love has forgotten them, but because their resistance runs deeper. Even so, the end toward which all are carried is not annihilation, but restoration—when every voice can finally speak truth, and every knee bends without compulsion.

Yet there is also a real loss that cannot be undone. Those who delay love’s work lose a nearness that cannot be recovered later. What might have been shared freely becomes something only admired from a distance. They are restored to life, yes—but not to the intimacy, trust, and shared joy that belonged to those who awakened earlier. Like one who realizes too late what was traded away, they live with a sorrow that remains, even as gratitude grows.

Still, this sorrow is not bitterness. Having come at last into the light, they are content with mercy. They rejoice in the glory of those who walk closer to the heart of God. They take their place within harmony, humbled but healed, grateful rather than resentful. Nothing remains outside love’s order. God is all in all.

Give this question your gentle attention:

> *What nearness to love feels precious to you now, while it is still freely offered?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *Your mercy waits even for me*
* Out: *I choose closeness while I can*
