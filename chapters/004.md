## 4 - Fire That Frees

> *What burns in God is not a desire to destroy, but a love determined to heal.*

God does not grow weary of creation, nor does patience run thin with time. What feels like anger is not a change in God, but a movement within Love itself—steady, unyielding, and unwilling to abandon what it has made. Love does not contend forever, not because it gives up, but because it knows how to wait until mercy can be received.

There are moments when Love must meet resistance firmly. When gentleness is refused, Love may arrive with weight and gravity. Yet even then, its aim is not domination or endless struggle. What is pressed upon the soul is meant to loosen what binds it, until obedience is no longer forced, but freely given—because the goodness of God has finally been tasted and trusted.

The fire spoken of in sacred language is not aimed at the erasure of the creature, but at the consuming of what harms it. What is burned away is not the self, but the corruption clinging to it. This is not painless work. What has entwined itself with fear, pride, or refusal does not release easily. Yet the fire is faithful—it burns only what cannot remain.

The long arc of Love bends toward freedom. What is bound will be loosened. What is fractured will be gathered. Even death itself is not exempt from this healing work. Love does not stop until nothing remains that resists life.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What in you longs to be freed, even if the process feels frightening?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Fire that heals*
- Out: *Free me for life*
