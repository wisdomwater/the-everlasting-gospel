## 15 - When Mercy Becomes Spacious

> *As we come to know our own need for mercy, our hearts naturally widen toward all.*

There is a kind of humility that does not arise from self-contempt, but from clear seeing. When we recognize how easily the heart bends toward self-protection, pride, or independence from Love, something softens in us. We stop imagining that our wounds are smaller, or our need less urgent, than anyone else’s.

In that clarity, mercy becomes precious—not because we are ashamed, but because we finally understand how deeply it is needed. Grace no longer feels like a reward for good behavior, but like oxygen. And when mercy is experienced this way, it becomes impossible to begrudge it to another. What has rescued us from our own inner exile is longed for on behalf of all.

The God who patiently restores human lives—again and again—does not grow weary or selective. What Love has already begun in us is not its final reach. What has been healed once can be healed again, wherever humility makes room. Renewal is not difficult for Love; resistance is the only delay.

At the deepest level, there is only one source of healing and one source of harm. What turns away fractures; what returns is restored. And because Love itself is the source of all things, nothing that humbles itself before Love is beyond renewal—no matter how long the journey takes.

Sit gently with this question:

> *How does your compassion shift when you remember how freely mercy has met you?*

- In: *Mercy received*
- Out: *Mercy shared*
