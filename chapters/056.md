## 56 - Justice That Restores

> *Divine justice is not driven by vengeance, but by a love that will not abandon what it seeks to heal.*

There is a seriousness to love that is easy to misunderstand. Love does not ignore what harms us. It does not pretend that distortion has no cost. Instead, it responds with a justice that is precise, measured, and purposeful—addressing each wound according to its truth, never more and never less. Nothing is overlooked; nothing is exaggerated.

This justice is not interested in pain for its own sake. Its aim is humility that opens the heart, a yielding that allows what is false to be released. Even when resistance is strong, love remains steady, working patiently until what opposes life loosens its grip and falls away. The end is never the creature’s destruction, but the destruction of what destroys the creature.

Seen this way, the harmony of God becomes clearer. Wisdom that knows how to bring every purpose to completion. Strength that can outlast every refusal without becoming cruel. Faithfulness that does not fail or forget. In this light, trust grows—not because consequences vanish, but because their meaning is revealed.

For the soul that sees this, justice no longer feels like a threat waiting in the distance. It becomes an invitation in the present: to consent now to the refining work of love, to allow what is harmful to be gently severed, and to come home sooner rather than later into deeper communion.

Sit gently with this question:

> *Where might I be invited to yield to healing now, rather than resist it?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *Holy love*
* Out: *Refine what is not life*
