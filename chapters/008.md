## 8 - What Is Not You

> *What God purifies is never the soul itself, but what has attached itself to it.*

Fire does not destroy gold—it reveals it. What cannot endure the flame is not the treasure, but the residue that never truly belonged. In the same way, Love does not labor endlessly against the soul; it works patiently against what obscures the soul’s brightness.

What is born from turning away—sin, distortion, fear—does not share the same origin as the creature itself. These things arise within time, cling for a season, and feel powerful while they remain, but they are not eternal. They do not have the same root as the life that carries them. And what lacks that root cannot last forever.

God does not make peace with what wounds creation. What is loathsome to Love is not preserved indefinitely. Yet the removal of what harms is not cruelty; it is mercy. Love does not tolerate corruption because it delights in punishment, but because it refuses to confuse the wound with the one who is wounded.

Even what we fear most about ourselves—our shadowed habits, our resistance, our inner fractures—is not the core of who we are. These are attachments, not essence. What is essential was made good, and what was made good is not discarded. It is refined.

Stay with this question in quiet attentiveness:

> *What if the part of you you most fear losing is not actually who you are?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *You know what is true*
- Out: *Refine, not erase*
