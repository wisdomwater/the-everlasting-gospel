## 36 - Born in Time, Awakened in Love

> *All are born for life, yet some awaken sooner, while others arrive by longer roads.*

Some discover the narrow way while the day is still bright. They sense the invitation early and choose it, not because they are better, but because they are ready. They let go of lesser satisfactions and learn, little by little, to pass through the small gate of trust. Their lives become a quiet yes to love before love must speak more loudly.

Others do not awaken so soon. The pull of the world feels stronger, the promises of immediacy more convincing. Like one who trades something precious for a moment’s comfort, they set aside what they do not yet understand. This is not spoken to shame them, but to name a sorrowful truth: what is postponed now must be learned later, often with greater cost.

Yet even here, hope is not withdrawn. Those who do not choose transformation in this life are not erased from God’s care. They are carried forward, through long and difficult seasons, until they too are made ready for life. Their path is slower, heavier, and marked by loss—but it still bends toward restoration. Love does not forget them. It waits, it works, it humbles and heals in its own time.

There is, then, no final division between those who belong and those who do not—only a difference of nearness, of timing, of joy freely chosen or slowly learned. Some are born into life early; others are born again after much darkness. But all awakening, in the end, is the work of the same faithful Love.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What invitation toward life might be present to you now, before it must come by a harder way?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You are patient with my becoming*
* Out: *I choose life where I can*
