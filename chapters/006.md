## 6 - The Long Yes of God

> *What Love begins, it does not abandon, even when it must wait through resistance.*

God’s desire does not flicker or weaken when it is met with refusal. What is willed from Love is held with a patience that can endure long seasons of delay. Resistance is real, but it is not ultimate. Love allows space—not because it is powerless, but because it honors freedom until freedom itself grows weary of exile.

There are times when we push back against what would heal us. We test other paths. We learn through contrast what we would not learn through words alone. Love does not panic in these seasons. It permits the journey, knowing that lived experience will teach what argument cannot.

Even pride and stubbornness are not beyond the reach of this patient will. What resists is not crushed, but slowly brought to humility—not through humiliation, but through truth finally seen and felt. What once stood opposed eventually yields, not because it is forced forever, but because it recognizes the goodness it once denied.

No resistance lasts without end. Not because God overpowers the soul, but because Love remains longer than defiance. What is real, good, and enduring will outlast what is rooted in fear or distortion. In time, every false strength loosens, and the heart remembers where it belongs.

Rest with this question:

> *Where might you trust that Love can wait you out without giving up on you?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Your will is patient*
- Out: *I yield in my own time*
