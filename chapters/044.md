## 44 - The Amen That Holds

> *The prayer sealed in love is not spoken in vain.*

When we whisper *Amen*, we are not offering polite closure. We are placing our trust into the hands of God. We are saying, *Let this be so—not as wishful thinking, but as truth carried to completion.* The final word of prayer is not uncertainty, but surrender to faithfulness.

The prayer we were given is wide enough to hold every life. It does not narrow its hope. It asks for healing, forgiveness, deliverance—not for a few, but for all. And it is spoken in the name of Love itself. To seal such a prayer with *Amen* is to believe that love knows how to finish what it begins, even when the path is long.

Some hearts resist for a time. Some wander far. Some learn slowly through pain what could not be learned gently. Yet resistance does not undo the prayer. Delay does not cancel mercy. What is asked in love continues to work, quietly and patiently, until it can be received. Goodness does not lose its way.

The promise beneath the prayer is simple and steady: love will not fail itself. What is asked in truth will be answered in truth. The joy promised is not fragile, nor dependent on human readiness alone. It is anchored in God’s own desire to heal, gather, and restore.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What might it be like to trust the “Amen” of love more than the evidence of resistance?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *Your will is faithful*
* Out: *So be it in me*
