## 27 - The Measure of What Endures

> *What shares God’s life has no beginning and no end; what does not will one day fall silent.*

There is a difference between what is eternal by nature and what only borrows the language of eternity. Love, glory, and life do not merely last a long time—they arise from God’s own being. They were not started, and they cannot be exhausted. They endure because God endures.

But pain does not live there. Separation does not flow from that source. What harms the soul does not share in God’s life and therefore cannot possess God’s endlessness. It may stretch far beyond our imagination, long enough to feel indistinguishable from forever, yet it does not reach backward into God, nor forward without limit. It has boundaries, even when those boundaries are hidden from us.

Human language strains when it speaks of time and beyond-time. The same words are used for seasons that pass and for life that never fades. This is not confusion—it is compassion. We are given words we can hold, not definitions we can master. The Spirit speaks in ways that meet us where we are, without forcing mystery into rigid measures.

What remains steady beneath all this is simple and trustworthy: God’s life is not rivaled by anything. Darkness does not stand beside light as an equal. Love does not share the throne with its opposite. In the end—however long the road—the only thing that endures without remainder is what has always belonged to God.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What would it mean for you to trust that love has deeper roots than fear?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *Your life has no end*
* Out: *I rest in what lasts*
