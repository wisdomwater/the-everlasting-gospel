## 39 - The Stillness Beyond All Ages

> *All striving moves toward a silence where only God remains.*

Scripture speaks of a world to come not as a distant abstraction, but as a long unfolding season—one in which healing, restoration, and reconciliation are patiently brought to completion. This future age does not begin in emptiness, but in fulfillment, when what has been quietly true is finally made visible. It is a time when love’s work is no longer resisted, and the long labor of restoration draws toward its end.

Throughout these ages, Christ holds what is broken with steady authority. Not the authority of force, but of faithful care. What opposes love is not crushed, but steadily undone. What is scattered is gathered. What was bent out of shape is returned to its original harmony. Nothing is hurried. Nothing is abandoned. All things are brought, in their own time, back into right relationship.

And then—beyond even these vast seasons—Scripture gestures toward something deeper still: a quiet eternity that does not move or change, because nothing remains to be healed. This is not another age, but rest itself. God is no longer known through struggle or contrast, but simply *is*. The noise of opposition fades. The language of fear falls silent. Only life remains, whole and unopposed.

In that stillness, nothing destructive survives. Not sin. Not death. Not separation. All that once wounded has been absorbed into victory. What began in goodness returns to goodness, now matured, now complete. God is all in all.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What part of you longs for a rest deeper than resolution—a stillness beyond striving?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You are before all ages*
* Out: *You are my final rest*
