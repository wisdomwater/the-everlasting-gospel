## Section 4 — Christ’s Victory Over Sin and Death

At the center of Scripture stands not a doctrine, but a person. Every promise, warning, judgment, and hope finds its meaning in Christ. However varied the voices of the biblical witness may be, they converge here—in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, where God’s purpose is not merely announced, but embodied.

To read Scripture faithfully is to read it through this lens. Christ does not soften God’s justice; he fulfills it. He does not bypass the cost of sin; he bears it. In his self-giving love, judgment and mercy meet—not as opposites, but as one redemptive act. Whatever cannot be reconciled to his love is exposed and undone; whatever can be healed is drawn in and restored.

These passages speak of a victory that is not partial or symbolic, but real and comprehensive. Sin does not have the final word. Death is not an equal rival. Christ’s work reaches as far as creation itself, touching what is seen and unseen, what is broken and what resists. Even where we do not yet see the fullness of this victory, Scripture insists that it is already underway, moving steadily toward completion.

Read these texts with attentiveness to their scope and their center. Notice how often *all things* are named. Notice how reconciliation, life, and peace flow outward from the cross. This is the gravity point of the Christian story: not fear of loss, but confidence in a love strong enough to carry creation through death and into life.

In these passages, Scripture draws our attention to a profound pattern of reversal. What begins in Adam—fracture, mortality, estrangement—is not merely countered in Christ, but taken up and healed. The language is careful and expansive: as far as the wound reaches, so does the remedy. Redemption is not portrayed as a partial repair, but as a deeper act that restores what was lost by carrying it through death and beyond.

This is why the victory of Christ is described in such comprehensive terms. Sin does not remain as a permanent rival. Death itself is named, faced, and undone. What is abolished is not humanity, but the forces that deform and divide it. The reign of Christ moves steadily toward an end—not the end of creation, but the end of separation—when all that opposes life has been brought to rest.

Notice, too, the tenderness woven into this triumph. Christ’s authority is not seized through domination, but received through self-giving love. He tastes death for everyone. He bears what cannot heal itself. His exaltation does not distance him from creation; it completes his solidarity with it. Even where the fullness of this victory is not yet visible, Scripture insists that nothing lies outside its reach.

The final vision offered here is not one of endless struggle, but of reconciliation. All things find their place again in the Source from which they came. What began in love returns to love, purified of what distorts and divides. God becomes “all in all”—not by erasing difference, but by restoring unity. In this light, Christ’s victory is not something we must secure or defend. It is something we are invited to trust, and to enter, as the long work of healing continues.
