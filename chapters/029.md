## 29 - Passing Through Death Toward Life

> *Death is not only an end we fear, but a condition we begin to leave the moment we turn toward life.*

Death, as the old teachers speak of it, is more than the moment when breath leaves the body. It is a state that begins wherever life is resisted—where fear tightens, where conscience grows heavy, where the heart becomes divided against itself. From the first turning away from love, something in us begins to ache, to fragment, to dim.

This is why the weight of suffering is not the same for everyone. Harm deepens as it is practiced. Some wounds go further into the soul than others. Justice, when it is true justice, does not crush indiscriminately; it responds with care, proportion, and restraint. Even judgment bears the shape of mercy, attending to what each life has carried and become.

The sacred language gathers all of this under one quiet word: death. Not as a threat, but as a description. Wherever sin takes hold, death follows naturally, as pain follows illness. It shows itself in anxiety, in fear, in separation, in the slow loss of inner freedom. And yet, even here, something astonishing is said: this death can be crossed while we are still breathing.

To turn toward God—even imperfectly—is already to begin rising. Life seeps back into what was numb. Peace touches what was restless. This passage from death to life is not dramatic or sudden for everyone; often it is gentle, unfolding day by day. But it is real. And it begins now.

Let this question rest in your care:

> *Where do you sense life quietly returning to you, even if only in small ways?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You awaken what was dead*
* Out: *Lead me into life*
