## 22 - Held Beyond Time

> *What is rooted in God is carried beyond every ending.*

There is a kind of “forever” that belongs to God alone—without beginning, without edge, simply being. This is not duration as we measure it, but fullness without limit. When sacred words speak this way, they are pointing not to length of time, but to depth of life.

There is another kind of enduring that belongs to what God brings forth. Created life begins, unfolds, and is sustained moment by moment by the One who never fades. When goodness lasts, it lasts because it is continually held. Its future is not secured by its own strength, but by the faithfulness of Love that does not withdraw.

This is how life promised by Christ is to be understood—not as a fragile reward that might expire, but as a participation in what does not perish. What is awakened in trust, what is drawn into communion, is joined to a source that does not run dry. The well keeps flowing because its spring is deeper than time.

To rest in this is to loosen our fear of loss. What truly lives in God is not threatened by change, nor undone by delay. It is carried, preserved, and gently brought forward—age after age—by a Love that knows how to keep what it has given.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What would it feel like to trust that what God gives is held securely, beyond time’s reach?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Held by the Eternal*
- Out: *I rest in Your keeping*
