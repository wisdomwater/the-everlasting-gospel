## Appendix: Scripture as Witness to Restoration

This book has been written for slow reading—for the heart, the body, and the places in us that have learned to brace when religious language becomes sharp. For that reason, I have kept the devotional chapters free from citations and debate. The aim has not been to win an argument, but to help a weary soul breathe again in the presence of a Love that restores.

And yet, for many readers, trust is not only a matter of feeling. The mind also longs for steady ground. Some come to this hope with a deep reverence for Scripture as God’s self-giving to humanity—a living witness that has shaped their conscience, comforted their sorrow, and named their longing for home. For those readers, it can be helpful to see that the vision of restoration is not a rejection of the biblical story, but a way of listening to it with patience, humility, and reverent attentiveness.

This appendix is offered in that spirit.

It is not a case to be won, nor a catalog of “proof texts.” It does not ask you to force Scripture into a predetermined conclusion, or to silence passages that feel difficult. Instead, it gathers a small set of passages as **companions**—connection points for prayerful reflection—so the intellect may be calmed and the conscience may feel less alone. If you have been taught that hope must be narrow in order to be faithful, you are invited simply to notice: *might the Bible, read in the full light of Christ, be more spacious than you expected?*

You are not required to arrive anywhere. You are welcome to read slowly, to hold questions without panic, and to let the Spirit teach you in the pace of love.

What follows is organized as six movements—six recurring currents in Scripture that, when held together, can open a wider horizon of trust:

1. **God’s Desire Is Wider Than We Were Taught**
2. **Judgment That Aims at Healing**
3. **The Language of Fire, Prison, and Exclusion**
4. **Christ’s Victory Over Sin and Death**
5. **All Things Made New**
6. **God All in All**
