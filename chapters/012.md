## 12 - The Wideness We Fear

> *Love is not diminished by being shared, nor threatened by reaching farther than we expect.*

There is something in us that grows uneasy when Love refuses our boundaries. We are taught, often quietly, to ration mercy—to believe that care must be earned, limited, protected from being “wasted.” And yet the Love revealed in God bears no resemblance to this fear. It is not smaller than human love; it is vast beyond comparison, like an ocean that does not run dry because many draw from it.

When we shrink the reach of mercy, we do not honor God—we protect our own certainty. A Love that embraces only a few feels easier to manage, easier to explain. But such narrowing does not heal the heart. It breeds anxiety, comparison, and quiet resentment, rather than freedom and trust.

The gospel, at its deepest, is not a message of exclusion but of restoration. It speaks to every creature not to flatter, but to awaken hope. It does not deny the seriousness of wandering or loss, but it refuses to make exile the final word. What is offered may be resisted, delayed, even squandered—but it is not revoked.

A Love that truly transforms does not rely on fear. It does not coerce belief or obedience. It works slowly, deeply, inviting the heart to soften from within. Where mercy is allowed to remain wide, humility grows, compassion deepens, and joy becomes possible again.

Sit gently with this question:

> *Where might fear be tempting you to make Love smaller than it truly is?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Love beyond measure*
- Out: *Free me from fear*
