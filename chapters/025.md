## 25 - When the Fire Has Nothing Left to Burn

> *Pain endures only as long as what wounds the soul remains unhealed.*

There is a way of living that closes itself to life—not because love withdraws, but because the heart refuses to receive it. In that state, judgment is not something imposed from outside; it is already being lived from within. The weight, the unrest, the burning sense of separation arise wherever trust has not yet taken root.

As long as harm clings to the soul, the ache continues. Pain feeds on what remains untransformed, like fire drawing breath from what can still be consumed. But suffering has no life of its own. It does not endure for the sake of cruelty or spectacle. It persists only while there is something within us that resists healing.

The ancient language speaks starkly about this, because the reality itself is stark. To live turned away from love is grievous. And yet, even here, love has not abandoned the creature. What is fierce is not the desire to destroy, but the seriousness with which truth meets what is false, and light meets what is dark—until darkness can no longer hide.

There is a mystery held alongside this severity: the same Love that allows pain to reveal the cost of separation also works, patiently and unceasingly, toward restoration. Nothing endures forever except what is born of God. When what wounds is finally released, the wound itself closes. When the fire has nothing left to burn, it goes out—not in defeat, but in fulfillment.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What feels painful in you right now because it has not yet been healed?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You see me as I am*
* Out: *You do not abandon me*
