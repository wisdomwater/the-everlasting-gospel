## 13 - The Measure We Carry

> *The mercy we withhold shapes the mercy we can receive.*

When the heart grows narrow, it often does so out of fear rather than malice. We shrink Love not because we delight in exclusion, but because we forget how much we ourselves depend on mercy. In that forgetting, compassion thins, and judgment begins to feel like safety.

There is a quiet truth woven through life: the way we regard others shapes the space we inhabit within ourselves. What we refuse to offer—patience, generosity, hope—we find harder to receive. Not because God mirrors our harshness in retaliation, but because our own hearts close against the flow that would heal them.

When Love feels hidden, it is not gone. Sometimes the absence we feel is an invitation to humility—a season where certainty dissolves so that longing may deepen. Even this is not abandonment, but a severe mercy, loosening pride and envy that cannot survive the light.

Remembering our shared fragility can soften us again. Without grace, none stand apart. Whatever goodness we know is borrowed breath. When this truth settles gently into us, the impulse to exclude fades, and compassion begins to feel like home rather than risk.

Spend a little time with this question:

> *Where might remembering your own need for mercy soften how you see others?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Mercy given freely*
- Out: *Mercy flowing through me*
