## 49 - When Every Voice Joins the Song

> *The end of God’s work is not silence, but praise freely given.*

There is a bowing that comes from fear, and there is a bowing that rises from recognition. Scripture leans toward the second. It imagines a day when every knee bends not because it must, but because truth has finally been seen clearly. What once resisted now recognizes love as Lord—and does so without coercion.

The vision is striking in its breadth. Nothing is left outside the chorus. Heaven and earth, depths and heights, even the places once marked by separation are gathered into a single act of blessing. Every tongue speaks not in protest or defeat, but in confession that gives glory. Praise becomes the natural language of restored life.

This can only happen if what opposed love has truly been undone. Sin cannot sing. Fear cannot bless. Condemnation cannot praise. And so the works of the adversary are not preserved as eternal counterpoints, but dissolved. What does not belong to love is destroyed—not the creature, but the wound that twisted it. The serpent’s work is undone at its root.

What remains is newness. Not a patched creation, but a renewed one. Not souls forced into order, but lives finally free to breathe and bless. God is not glorified by endless enemies, but by healed ones. And in that healing, every voice finds its place in the song.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What would it be like to imagine even your deepest resistance someday turning into praise?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You make all things new*
* Out: *I join the song of life*
