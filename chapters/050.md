## 50 - The Gospel for Every Creature

> *The good news is as wide as creation and as faithful as God.*

When the One on the throne says, “I make all things new,” it is spoken without narrowing. Not a few things. Not most things. Not the easy things. *All things.* The promise carries the scent of the beginning—when everything was called good—and it points toward a future where goodness is not partial, but complete.

This is why the gospel is announced to every creature. It is not a private rescue for a select corner of the world, but glad tidings meant for all who labor under the weight of separation. It proclaims a Savior whose healing reaches as far as sin has spread, and whose patience is long enough to restore what has been most deeply damaged.

The apostles carried this hope as something living and universal—good news under heaven, not merely good advice for the already-ready. The message is not that life is easy now, but that no creature is finally abandoned, and no darkness is final. The gospel is hope with breadth, not a consolation with limits.

Even the difficult passages that seem to restrict this hope can be held gently and read with care. Sometimes what appears to exclude is actually describing the first movement of mercy—the way Christ first “takes hold” of humanity in a particular, embodied way—without implying that his reconciling reach ends there. Love begins somewhere, but it does not end there.

Sit gently with this question:

> *Where have you quietly assumed the good news must have limits—and what would it feel like to let it be wider?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You make all things new*
* Out: *Let this include me*
