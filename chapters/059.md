## 59 - Love That Does Not Contradict Itself

> *When love is trusted to be whole and faithful, the heart finds a God it can finally believe in.*

There is a deep confusion that arises when love is praised with words but denied in outcome. When mercy is spoken of as wide, yet imagined as finally ineffective; when promises are proclaimed, yet expected to fall short. Such contradictions do not nourish faith. They quietly erode it. The soul senses the dissonance and grows weary of holding together what does not belong.

But when love is seen as coherent—when mercy, justice, wisdom, and power move together without rivalry—something in us relaxes. God no longer appears divided against himself. What is promised is not undone. What is begun is not abandoned. Love does not exhaust itself halfway through the story.

In this vision, judgment does not oppose compassion, nor does holiness diminish mercy. God hates only what deforms life, never the life itself. The work of justice is not to discard the creature, but to free it. And because love remains faithful to its own nature, even the most resistant darkness is not stronger than the light that seeks it.

Such a God does not require denial of reason or suppression of conscience. Instead, trust becomes possible. Faith becomes breathable. The heart can rest in a goodness that does not unravel under scrutiny, a love that carries all things from their beginning through their healing and homecoming.

Dwell with this question:

> *What shifts in me when I imagine a love that never contradicts itself?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *Faithful light*
* Out: *I rest in You*
