## 17 - Strong Enough to Free

> *The Love revealed in Christ does not abandon what it has come to heal.*

When we speak of redemption, we are speaking of strength joined to compassion. A true rescuer does not lose interest when the work becomes difficult, nor does Love retreat because the chains are tight. What Christ carries into the world is not a symbolic hope, but a living power that meets captivity with patience and resolve.

Resistance is real. Hearts harden. Fear clings. Habits bind. Yet these are not signs that Love has failed, only that healing is not yet complete. What resists grace is often itself a wound—something learned, something endured, something held out of fear. Love does not mistake this resistance for final refusal.

Christ does not tire of the work of freeing. What binds the human heart—confusion, blindness, self-protection—does not outlast mercy. The keys of life and death rest not in the hands of fear, but in the hands of One who knows how to wait, how to loosen, how to lead prisoners out into air and light when the moment is ready.

Some taste freedom sooner and are entrusted with deeper joy. Others must walk longer paths through humility and unlearning. But none are forgotten. Redemption is not a narrow victory snatched from loss; it is a steady triumph that continues until nothing remains unhealed.

Let this question find its own time:

> *Where might you trust that Love has not finished its work yet—either in you or in others?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Stronger than every chain*
- Out: *Finish Your work in me*
