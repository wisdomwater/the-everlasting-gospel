## 1 - The Heart That Gives Itself

> *Everything that comes from God carries the quiet signature of Love.*

There are many ways words have tried to speak of God—light, fire, spirit, glory—but beneath every name rests a single pulse. However God is described, the descriptions bend toward one center: Love. Not an idea of love, not a mood or preference, but Love as essence, steady and unchanging.

This Love is not distant or abstract. It moves, creates, sustains. Even what feels severe or incomprehensible to us does not arise from indifference or cruelty, but from a depth we do not yet see. What comes from Love may at times feel mysterious or weighty, but it is never born of harm.

Nothing that exists is outside this originating care. Creation itself is not an accident or experiment—it is an outpouring. To be made is already to be held within intention. Whatever has been touched by God’s hands carries the mark of that giving.

And because Love does not turn against itself, it does not abandon what it has formed. What is true in God remains true toward us: patience, faithfulness, and a desire not to discard, but to restore.

Quietly ask yourself:

> *Where in your life might you gently allow the possibility that what feels hard is not loveless?*

**Breath Prayer:**

- In: *Love at the center*
- Out: *I rest within You*
