## 21 - The Depth of Forever

> *Not everything called “everlasting” rests on the same kind of ground.*

There is a quiet wisdom in noticing how words stretch and change depending on what they are asked to carry. When we speak of God, “everlasting” points beyond time itself—without beginning, without end. God is not held by duration; duration is held by God.

Created things live differently within time. They begin, they unfold, they are sustained. When goodness endures, it does so because it is rooted in the life of God, continually upheld by Love that does not fade. What remains is not self-powered, but held.

Other things—fear, distortion, harm—do not share this root. They arise within time and depend on conditions that do not last forever. They feel immense while they endure, but they are not grounded in the same depth. They are permitted for a season, not granted infinity.

To sense this is not to solve a puzzle, but to rest in a truth: only what participates in God’s own life can endure without end. Everything else, no matter how loud or heavy it feels now, lives on borrowed time.

Approach this question with patience:

> *What in your life feels endless—but might not be rooted in what truly lasts?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *You are from everlasting*
- Out: *I rest in what endures*
