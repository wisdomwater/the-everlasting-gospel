## 7 - What Cannot Last Forever

> *Only what is rooted in Love can endure without end.*

There is a quiet coherence to reality. Love does not compete with its opposite forever, nor does life grant equal permanence to what undermines it. What flows from God shares in God’s endurance; what arises from turning away does not possess the same staying power.

We live, move, and exist within a Source that holds us continually. Our being is not self-made, nor self-sustaining. What is born from this deep belonging carries a future because it is nourished by something eternal. What is aligned with Love can rest within it without fear of vanishing.

But what grows from separation—fear, distortion, harm—does not have the same root. These things are permitted for a time, endured with patience, but they are not granted permanence. They are not who we are. They are attachments, not essence. And what is not essential will not last.

Love does not erase the creature to remove the wound. It burns away what does not belong so that what is true may remain. What is consumed is not the soul, but what obscures it. The end is not loss, but return—back to a simplicity and purity that was always intended.

Carry this question with you:

> *What in you might be temporary, even if it feels deeply entrenched right now?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Rooted in Love*
- Out: *I release what cannot last*
