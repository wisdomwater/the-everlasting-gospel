## 16 - Stronger Than All Loss

> *The healing Love revealed in Christ is deeper and more enduring than anything that resists it.*

At the heart of faith lies a quiet confidence: that Love is not fragile. What God has done in Christ is not a tentative gesture or a partial remedy, but a work grounded in strength—steady, patient, and complete. A true deliverer is not weaker than what binds; redemption does not bow before corruption.

The mercy revealed through Christ does not flicker according to human response. It does not exhaust itself quickly or depend on perfect timing. Love enters the places of captivity not with haste, but with resolve, willing to remain present until freedom becomes possible. What it touches, it does not forget.

It may appear, for long seasons, that harm has the upper hand—that loss is winning, that fear is louder, that many wander far from the path of life. Yet appearances are not the measure of Love’s power. Redemption does not announce itself through numbers or immediacy, but through faithfulness that outlasts resistance.

What Christ carries is not a narrow rescue, but a strength capable of bearing the weight of the whole world. Nothing that has fallen lies beyond this reach. Grace is not diminished by delay, nor defeated by refusal. It works until its work is done.

Sit gently with this question:

> *What changes in you when you trust that Love is stronger than everything that has gone wrong?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *Stronger than all loss*
- Out: *I rest in Your power*
