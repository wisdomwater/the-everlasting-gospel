## 28 - When All Things Are Gathered

> *Every season of rule and correction serves love’s purpose, until all things rest again in God.*

There is a work entrusted to Christ within time—a patient, purposeful governance where what resists love is met, named, and slowly transformed. This work is not endless because its aim is not endless struggle, but completion. When healing has done what it came to do, it does not linger. It yields, not in failure, but in fulfillment.

There comes a moment when nothing remains outside harmony—when every will has been softened, every wound tended, every resistance finally laid down. Then what was provisional gives way to what is eternal. Christ does not lose glory in this yielding; it deepens. Love does not shrink when it returns all things to the Father; it shines more fully.

The language of ages and ages speaks to us not of rivalry between light and darkness, but of patience—of time given generously for truth to do its work. Even the hardest places are held within this patience. They last as long as they must, and no longer. When every creature is brought into willing belonging, the work of correction is complete, and only communion remains.

What endures beyond all ages is not a system of rule, but relationship. Not governance, but belonging. Not correction, but rest.

Pause with this question:

> *What part of you longs for a season of struggle to finally give way to peace?*

**Breath Prayer:**

* In: *You complete what You begin*
* Out: *I trust the fullness of Your love*
