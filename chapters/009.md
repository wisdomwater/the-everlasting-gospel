## 9 - Returning to Right Use

> *Sin is not the substance of the soul, but the misdirection of what was made good.*

What we call sin is not a foreign substance stitched into the soul. It is not a second self. It is disorder—good capacities turned away from their true center. The mind grows dim not because it was made dark, but because it looks toward what cannot satisfy. Desire becomes restless not because it was wrong, but because it has forgotten its home.

Conversion, then, is not the creation of a new being, but a return to right use. What was scattered is gathered. What was misapplied is reoriented. The same hands, the same mind, the same body—now offered back into harmony. Nothing essential is lost; something essential is restored.

God does not hate what God has made. What Love opposes is not the creature, but the confusion that clings to it. Even in deep corruption, there remains something that God recognizes and cherishes—the being God gave, the life that still depends on divine breath. That core is never despised, never revoked.

No creature can undo its own existence. What was called into being by Love cannot erase itself, even through misuse or rebellion. And because that being remains, Love remains with it—patiently, steadfastly—working not to annihilate the creature, but to disentangle it from what does not belong.

Live into this question:

> *Where might you see disorder in your life not as condemnation, but as something waiting to be gently reordered?*

**Breath Prayer**

- In: *You made me good*
- Out: *Restore what is misaligned*
