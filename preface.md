## Preface

This book was not written to settle an argument.

It was written because, for many souls, something in the story of God had begun to feel fractured—love proclaimed with words, yet limited in outcome; mercy preached, yet imagined as fragile; judgment emphasized, yet severed from healing. Over time, these tensions can erode trust, not only in doctrine, but in God.

*The Everlasting Gospel* was first published in 1705 by Georg Klein-Nicolai, a Lutheran pastor shaped by Scripture, pastoral care, and a deep concern for holiness of life. Writing in an age marked by doctrinal division and fear-driven theology, Klein-Nicolai sought to hold together what he believed Scripture itself refused to separate: God’s justice and God’s mercy, the seriousness of sin and the persistence of divine love.

His vision was neither permissive nor sentimental. He took judgment seriously—more seriously, perhaps, than many of his contemporaries. But he insisted that judgment has an end beyond itself: the destruction of sin, not the abandonment of the sinner; the healing of creation, not its permanent division. For Klein-Nicolai, a God whose purposes do not finally succeed would be less than fully sovereign—and a love that does not restore would be incomplete.

The original work is dense, polemical, and shaped by the theological controversies of its time. This devotional adaptation does not attempt to modernize those arguments or reproduce their tone. Instead, it seeks to distill the *essence* of the vision beneath them: a patient God, a purposeful justice, and a love that does not fail to finish what it begins.

This book is offered as a companion for slow reading. It does not ask you to agree, only to attend. It does not demand certainty, only openness. It is written especially for those who have grown cautious with religious language—those who love God but struggle to reconcile that love with fear, coercion, or despair.

If you carry questions, you are welcome here.

If you carry wounds, you are not alone.

If you carry hope, even tentatively, may it find room to breathe.

May these reflections help you rest—not in answers mastered, but in a Love that is faithful, coherent, and whole.
