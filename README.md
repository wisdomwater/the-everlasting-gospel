# The Everlasting Gospel (Devotional Edition)

A contemplative devotional adaptation of *The Everlasting Gospel* (1705) by Georg Klein-Nicolai, re-expressed for slow, pastoral reading.

This project is not a modernized polemical translation, nor a theological argument.  
Its aim is **assurance**, **healing**, and **trust**—inviting readers into a vision of divine love that restores rather than abandons.

## 📖 About This Project

*The Everlasting Gospel* was first published in 1705 by Georg Klein-Nicolai, a Lutheran pastor writing in an era marked by doctrinal rigidity and fear-based theology. His central conviction was simple yet radical:  
**God’s justice is real and serious, but it is always ordered toward restoration, not endless separation.**

This repository contains a **modern contemplative devotional adaptation** of that work. The original argumentative structure has been distilled into short, daily reflections intended for prayerful reading rather than debate.

The devotional emphasizes:

- love that does not contradict itself  
- judgment as purposeful and restorative  
- Christ’s victory over sin and death as complete  
- the renewal of all things  
- the final harmony of God being *all in all*

## 🕊️ Intent & Posture

This work is written for readers who may be:

- weary of fear-driven or coercive religion  
- cautious with theological certainty  
- wounded by rigid doctrines of exclusion  
- seeking a gentler, more trustworthy vision of God  

It does **not** attempt to convince, debate, or correct.  
Truth here is offered as something to be **received**, not enforced.

## 📚 Structure

The devotional is organized as **daily readings**, each following a consistent, simple format:

- A short, image-based title  
- A one-sentence summary  
- A brief contemplative reflection  
- A gentle, invitational question  
- A short breath prayer  

The book is meant to be read **slowly**, one entry at a time, and returned to as needed.

An appendix is included for readers who trust Scripture as authoritative, offering a pastoral, non-polemical exploration of key biblical movements related to restoration and hope.
